description:    Impact of rkt/containers on public traffic routing with BGP
---

# Context

Until now, routing of public traffic to our front servers was done via some particular servers, called `load-balancers`(LB) in our infrastructure. These servers were built with `nginx` for SSL-offloading, `varnish` for the reverse-proxy part, and `ExaBGP` for the communication with our BGP routers.

Our infrastructure's move to `containers` with `rkt` has lead us to re-consider the cooperation of these components.

# Existing infrastructure

For the current design, I was inspired by Vincent Bernat's excellent post: [High availability with ExaBGP](<http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2013-exabgp-highavailability.html>)

When applied to our own infra, it looked like this:
<img src="/images/2016-01-06-bgp-routing-to-containers/old-infra1.png" class="block" style="width: 352px;" />

Each of the `load-balancers` is running [ExaBGP](<https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp>), which is talking with BGP routers. Config example of one of them: 

{% highlight python %}
group neighbors {
  neighbor 91.238.131.1 {
    router-id 91.238.131.5;
    local-address 91.238.131.5;
    local-as 65001;
    peer-as 202069;
  }
  neighbor 91.238.131.2 {
    router-id 91.238.131.5;
    local-address 91.238.131.5;
    local-as 65001;
    peer-as 202069;
  }
}
{% endhighlight%}

With `ExaBGP`, we also use its `healthcheck` plugin, which is continuously testing the resource and, if available, annoucning some `VIPs`:

{% highlight python %}
process healthcheck-apex {
  run /etc/exabgp/processes/healthcheck.py --config /etc/exabgp/healthcheck-apex.conf;
}
{% endhighlight%}

Let's check `healthcheck-apex.conf` in detail:

{% highlight python %}
name = apex
interval = 10
fast-interval = 1
command = curl -sf http://127.0.0.1/healthcheck
ip = 91.238.131.166
ip = 91.238.131.167
{% endhighlight %}

Second `LB`'s config looks the same, except the VIPs order:

{% highlight python %}
name = apex
interval = 10
fast-interval = 1
command = curl -sf http://127.0.0.1/healthcheck
ip = 91.238.131.167
ip = 91.238.131.166
{% endhighlight %}

Why this difference ?

It is connected with the way `healthcheck` works. For each specified VIP, `healthcheck` makes an announce to `ExaBGP`, increasing the `med` attribute by 1. Example on the first `LB`:

    announce route 91.238.131.166/32 next-hop self med 100
    announce route 91.238.131.166/32 next-hop self med 101

It means that each `LB` is announcing the same VIP set, but with a different weight (using `med`). As a consequence, BGP routers only route traffic for a particular VIP to a single `LB`.

Just publish these 2 VIPs into DNS for a particular service (*apex* here), and you'll obtain a highly available service.

In case of `LB` failure, it won't announce its VIPs anymore. Fortunately, BGP routers know at least another route, towards the second LB, so the service keeps working.

# Behaviour with containers

In our new datacenter, we are using `rkt containers` exclusively, as the basic run unit. Every servers are the same, and they run only a single operating system: `CoreOS`. This infrastructure is massively automated.

From a network point of view, we used this huge change as an opportunity to switch from a `L2` to a `L3 model`, since we don't need VLANs anymore. Network isolation is reached using ACLs that are pre-generated and deployed onto CoreOS (the same principle as AWS security groups).

Therefore, we setup BGP on each level, from edge routers to top-of-rack (ToR) switches. It looks like this:

<img src="/images/2016-01-06-bgp-routing-to-containers/new-infra1.png" class="block" style="width: 346px;" />

Then, in each rack, a single `CoreOS` server is dedicated to load-balancing. It runs a set of containers (called a `pod`), and this pod is in charge of running ExaBGP, and announce the VIPs handled by this LB.

`ExaBGP` config sample on rack #1: 

{% highlight python %}
group neighbors {
  neighbor 10.20.151.129 {
    router-id 10.20.151.147;
    local-address 10.20.151.147;
    local-as 64147;
    peer-as 64001;
  }
  neighbor 10.20.151.130 {
    router-id 10.20.151.147;
    local-address 10.20.151.147;
    local-as 64147;
    peer-as 64001;
  }
}
{% endhighlight%}

## Problem encountered

When running our first tests, we encountered a problem pretty fast: for a particular service, whatever the number of LB instances was, only one LB was receiving all of the traffic.

After troubleshooting, it appears that the behaviour was as expected. Each LB was announcing the same VIPs, with a different `med`, and this `med` was taken into account by the correspondig ToR.

However, the VIP, when re-announced by the ToR to the upper level (aggregation switches), was loosing its `med` attribute. This behaviour is by design in BGP when ASN changes: [med is a non-transitive attribute](<http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13759-37.html>)

Edge routers were knowing different routes, but with different as-paths (non-eligble to `bgp-multipath`, thus). So they chose the older route, which is online with the behaviour seen: only a single LB (the first started) receives all of the traffic.

## Workarounds

We thought about several workarounds: 

* bgp multihop
* route server
* BGP community values
* ExaZK

### BGP multihop

First idea we had: connect the LBs directly to aggregation switches, and not to ToR. We had to use multihop mode of BGP:

    router bgp 65002
      neighbor a.b.c.d remote-as 64xxx
        ebgp-multihop 2

Unfortunately, using this solution, next-hop attribute for the received routes was unknown in the IGP of the aggregation layer. Thus, the route was not inserted into RIB.

### Route server

Next idea was to use a route server. Instead talking to ToR, the LBs would have to talk to aggregation layer in route-server mode. Here again, we were luckless: our aggregation switches are Cisco Nexus 3064, and their implementation of BGP does not include support for the `route-server-client` directive.

### BGP community

Another idea: rather than using a non-transitive attribute like `med` is, what about using a transitive one: community. Despite this idea was pretty sexy, we dropped it because:

* high complexity of `route-maps` that we would have to implement on the aggregation layer, to handle this community values properly.
* need to modify the source-code of `healthcheck`, in order to use `community` rather than `med`

### ExaZK

Since the best idea we had implied to modify `healthcheck`'s source code, we thought it would be worth writing our own plugin, and to connect it directly to our service directory.

Indeed, in our container oriented infrastructure, orchestration of the containers (instancing, quantity, deployment ...) is highly relying on `ZooKeeper`.

It appeared to us that `ExaBGP` should speak directly with `ZooKeeper` to determine what to announce to BGP routers. Accordingly, we chose to code this plugin: [ExaZK](<https://github.com/shtouff/exazk>)

<img src="/images/2016-01-06-bgp-routing-to-containers/new-infra2.png" class="block" style="width: 507px;" />

Principle is:

* regarding a particular service, say *apex*, we run 3 LB pods, on 3 different CoreOS servers, located in 3 different racks
* each of these pods is running `ExaBGP` with `ExaZK`
* each ExaZK instance announces only one VIP, for whose this instance is authoritative (`auth_ip` parameter)
* each ExaZK instance writes down to ZK its health state, using an ephemeral node


{% highlight python %}
group neighbors {
  neighbor 172.28.128.11 {
    router-id 172.28.128.1;
    local-address 172.28.128.1;
    local-as 65001;
    peer-as 65011;
  }
  process exazk-apex {
    run /exazk/exazk.py -sF daemon -c /exazk/check_local_nginx.sh -n apex -A 10.20.255.1 -N 10.20.255.2 -N 10.20.255.3 -zH localhost -zPS /exabgp/service/apex -zPM /exabgp/maintenance/apex;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

* when an instance dies, its ephemeral node in ZK goes with it. The other instances catch this event
* the other instances then announce the VIP of the faulty instance, until it comes back online.

A special mode, called `maintenance`, can be used to completely put a service offline: should an operator make this special node exists in ZK, the LBs would withdraw all the VIPs.

Last, a local check (same principle as used in `healthcheck`) allows every instance of `ExaZK` to check itself.

`ExaZK`is still under testing. If it's of some interest to you, and you want to modify it to your needs, feel free to fork it on [github](<https://github.com/shtouff/exazk>) !

Cheers !
